progress over time.

## Contributing

If you found this repo by looking for #hacktoberfest repositories, welcome! You may notice it's a
very basic app. This app is partly a learning-in-public project for me, but may also be cool for
someone else to help out with a maybe-neat app idea. Of course, if you're an experienced Android
developer, your experience and help would be greatly appreciated!

If you're interested in contributing, with a new feature, code review, bug fix, documentation, or 
any other way, please make an issue first with a basic description of the feature! I'll take a look
and we'll figure out how to get it started!
